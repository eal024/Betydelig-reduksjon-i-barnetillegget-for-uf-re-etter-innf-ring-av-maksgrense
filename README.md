# Reduction in child supplements for recipients of disability benefits.
  
From 2016, benefits for disability insurance recipients who receive child supplements are subject to a maximum permitted amount. The new regulation determines that the sum of disability benefits and child supplements can not exceed 95 percent of recipients’ income prior to disability. In this article I address this policy change and examine how it affected child supplements for recipients of disability insurance. I also investigate whether the policy change had an effect on recipients’ labor supply.
I find that the policy change caused a substantial reduction in child supplements. In 2015, child supplements for those exceeding 95 percent replacement were 95 000 NOK on average. Since the change was implemented gradually, average child supplements decreased during the period. In 2021, when the policy change was fully incorporated, average child supplements were 51 000 NOK on average. I estimate that recipients would have received an additional 30 000 NOK without the policy change.
As recipients with many children and low income prior to disability received the most benefits in relation to their pre-disability income, these recipients were affected the most by the policy change. Among those with more than three children, the average annual reduction in child supplements in 2021 was 62 000 NOK.
I do not have sufficient statistical power to conclude that the policy change had an impact on labor market earnings for the full sample of recipients eligible for child supplements. However, I do find significant effects for some subgroups. For every 1000 NOK reduction in child supplements, men replace the lost benefits by increasing labor market earnings by about 200 NOK on average (2019-2021). I also find weak evidence of the policy change having an impact on labor supply of partially disabled recipients.
